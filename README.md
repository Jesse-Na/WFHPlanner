# WFHPlanner

To run the project, clone the repo, navigate to it, install all dependencies and execute the command "flask run" in the terminal.

## Inspiration
We asked ourselves the question: How could we make the lives of individuals working from home easier? Our response was to address the fundamental problem of remote work, work-life balance.
## What it does
Work From Home (WFH) Planner is a web application tool that helps those working from home to better manage their day, by auto-generating a schedule for them to follow throughout the day. Users put in the tasks that they need to finish by the end of the work day and we do some work behind the scenes to come up with a timeline that balances work and home life so that users can maximize their productivity and stay mentally healthy.
## How we built it
We used Flask in Python to set up our server and SQLite as our database in the back-end. On the other side, we used standard CSS with Bootstrap for our front-end tech stack. 
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges such as user authentication, back-end logic issues, and hosting our application on the cloud.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite all of the difficulties, we managed to at least get some basic functionality in our web application and were able to put into practice some healthy development practices such as planning out our UI using a tool like figma, and mapping out our database.
## What we learned
In hindsight, there were many things that we had to do manually since we took such a bare bone approach to development which might have been quicker had we used frameworks like React.js and libraries like authlib.
## What's next for WFH Planner
The best path forward would be to re-examine our tech stack and ask ourselves, based on what we've learned, how exactly are we going to go about implementing the features that we want to implement. If we can see a clear path forward then we will take it, but if there seems to be an easier way by using a certain library or technology not currently in our stack, then perhaps it would be a better idea to factor that in.
